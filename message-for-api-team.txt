Subject: API Connection Issue RESOLVED - Thank You!

Hi API Team,

Great news! The CORS configuration changes you made have successfully resolved our API connection issues. The health endpoint is now returning a 200 OK response with the expected data:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-15T03:45:46Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "development",
  "database_connection": true
}
```

We're also successfully retrieving images from the `/api/v1/images` endpoint. Our frontend application can now properly detect that the API is available and is using the real data instead of mock data.

We had to make a small adjustment to handle the response format from the images endpoint (which returns an array of images directly), but that was a simple fix on our side.

Thank you for your quick response and help in resolving this issue. The collaboration between our teams has been excellent.

Best regards,
Frontend Team
